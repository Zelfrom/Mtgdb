## issue description, importance statement

Example:

When I input my physical collection into the application I can't see both collection and the full 
catalog at the same time. So it is difficult to visually compare my progress with the physical piles 
of card in front of me. I have to constantly switch the filter by collection on and off. Also, the 
collection cards are not shown in any particular order which makes comparing with physical 
collection much harder.

## suggested solution (for feature or improvement requests)

Example:

I suggest showing the collection as one more tab in deck areas, in addition to Main Deck, Sideboard 
and Sample hand tabs. The order of cards in collection should be editable like it's in deck.

## Steps to reproduce (for bug reports)

Example:

1. Run the program
2. Wait until update window icon becomes enabled
3. Click it just after it became enabled

Result: the application crashes

Expected result: Upate window is shown
